Explanation of each statement:

#include <iostream>: This line includes the input/output stream library, which is necessary for performing input and output operations in C++.

using namespace std;: This line specifies that the program will use the std (standard) namespace, which contains standard C++ functions and objects.

int main (){: This line marks the beginning of the main function, which is the entry point of the program.

int inches;: This line declares an integer variable named inches to store the user input.

cout << "Enter the number of inches on a side " << endl;: This line displays a prompt asking the user to enter the number of inches on a side. The endl is used to move the cursor to the next line.

cout << "Press the return key." << endl;: This line displays a prompt asking the user to press the return key.

cin >> inches;: This line reads the user input (the number of inches) and stores it in the inches variable.

cout << endl << "The area is " << inches * inches << "." << endl;: This line calculates and displays the area of the square (side * side).

return 0;: This line indicates that the program executed successfully, and the main function returns an integer value of 0.
